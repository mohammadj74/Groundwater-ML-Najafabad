# Groundwater Level Prediction Using Machine Learning in the Najafabad Plain

This repository contains the source code and datasets used in the research paper titled:

**"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms for Groundwater Level Prediction in the Najafabad Plain"**

## ðŸ“˜ Description
This project aims to model and predict groundwater level fluctuations in the Najafabad plain (Iran) using three machine learning algorithms:

- Random Forest (RF)
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The models were developed and tested across five hydrogeological zones using a combination of climatic, hydrological, and anthropogenic variables.
